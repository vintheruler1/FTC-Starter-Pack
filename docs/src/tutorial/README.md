# Tutorial using Android Studios

::: tip
This also works with any Java built IDE from IntelliJ (if you don't know what this is, just use Android Studios :))
:::

## Prerequisites

You will need to have Android Studio installed on your computer. You can download it [here](https://developer.android.com/studio).

Java 8 is also required. You can download it [here](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).

### Downloading the Pack

### Opening using Android Studios

You can now open the project in Android Studio. You can do this by opening Android Studio and clicking "Open an existing Android Studio project". Then, you will need to find the folder that you just unzipped and click "Open".
