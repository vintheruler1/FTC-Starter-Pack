## Getting Started

This FTC starter pack was mainly used to teach the team 5467 how to code during FTC Centerstage. So this will be using SDK and FTC Robot Controller version 9.0.1.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have Android Studio installed on your computer. You can download it [here](https://developer.android.com/studio).

Java 8 is also required. You can download it [here](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).

### Installing

First, you will need to download the starter pack. You can do this by clicking the green button that says "Clone or download" and then click "Download ZIP".

Then, you will need to unzip the file. You can do this by right clicking the file and clicking "Extract All".

You can now open the project in Android Studio. You can do this by opening Android Studio and clicking "Open an existing Android Studio project". Then, you will need to find the folder that you just unzipped and click "Open".

Congratulations! You have now installed the starter pack!

## Debreifing

### What should I touch and what can I not touch?

Please only edit the files in the "teamcode.src.main.java.org.firstinspires.ftc.teamcode" folder.
The reason why is because this was made by FTC to interact with other things. Touching this or the gradle could potentially break the project.

### What is an OpMode?

An OpMode is a piece of code that tells the robot what to do. There are two types of OpModes: TeleOp and Autonomous. TeleOp is the OpMode that is used when the robot is being controlled by a driver. Autonomous is the OpMode that is used when the robot is being controlled by itself.

### Do you have any example files??

Of course I do. Inside of their respective folders, there are two example OpModes. One for TeleOp and one for Autonomous. You can use these as a reference for your own OpModes.

### How do I learn more?

A wiki will be coming out soon about this and I will consider making tutorial vidoes.
For now, if you need help, just create an issue and I will try to help you ASAP.

## Using the Starter Pack

### Creating a new OpMode

To create a new OpMode, you will need to right click the "org.firstinspires.ftc.teamcode.TeleOp" folder and click "New" and then "Java Class".

You now can make your own OpMode!! You can now do the same for autonomous by making sure you are in the "org.firstinspires.ftc.teamcode.Autonomous" folder and creating a new Java class.
